JsScript
========

Possibly the least hyped feature of the El Capitan OS X update was a newer version of the terminal utility `script`. It now supports recording the timing of keypresses along with the input and output. The entire session can then be played back, like a text-based screencast.

JsScript lets you replay recorded terminal sessions on a website.

To record a terminal session, run `script -r` on any BSD system, like Mac OS X. It has been available in FreeBSD since [Jul 2012](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/c60a6d31064674dbbba56ef3038ef105a1cdd8a8#diff-b65c05df5b548732d18f8800c409d4c0). The Gnu version of `script` is not compatible.
